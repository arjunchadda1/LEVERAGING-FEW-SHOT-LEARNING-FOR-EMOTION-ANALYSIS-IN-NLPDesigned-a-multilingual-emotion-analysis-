# Data Mining Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates various data mining concepts, techniques, and implementations using Python. It is intended for academic use and individual learning.

## Project Overview

The notebook includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing (cleaning, transformation, normalization)
- Feature Selection and Extraction
- Classification Models (e.g., Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors)
- Clustering Algorithms (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN)
- Evaluation Metrics (e.g., Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Silhouette Score)
